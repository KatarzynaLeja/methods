Protein BLAST was performed using TATOOINE sequence. For the alignment we used results from BLAST and sequences of proteins from cryptochrome and photolyase family,
to which TATOOINE could belong. For drought resistance assay watering of plants was suspended to induce drought stress. 
After 26 days plants were watered again. Structure modeling was performed using PyMOL software. Lipid content has been quantified by SPE-HPLC-MS.
